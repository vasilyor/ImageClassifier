## Project: ImageClassifier
### Data Scientist Nanodegree - Deep Learning

##### In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then I converted it into a command line application.


### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Python 3.x ](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PtTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)



### Data
---
Dataset of 102 flower categories, can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html">here</a> 


### The project is broken down into multiple steps:
---
- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content
